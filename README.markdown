# Open Everything

The Open Everything exhibit was created to introduce the concept of information as a commodity and to begin a conversation about access to information. The exhibit encourages students to explore Open Access, Open Data, Open Education Resources, and Open Source Software. It is an interactive exhibit developed with the intent of making you want to learn more about the ways information is created and distributed.

The physical exhibit opened at the Mary Idema Pew Library Learning and Information Commons on August 8 and ran until September 18, 2014. 

This repository holds the interactive web version of the exhibit, which is live at [gvsu.edu/library/openeverything](http://gvsu.edu/library/openeverything).
