	<h3>Information is a commodity.</h3>
	
	<p>Just like any other commodity, it can be bought and sold. Quality information costs time and money to produce, and those who produce it often limit access to recover costs and make a profit.</p>
	
	<h3>Information is also a public good.</h3>
	
	<p>Producing information will always come at a price, but limiting access to it can impede the advancement of knowledge, slow down innovation, and stunt scientific and social progress.</p>
	
	<h3>Open information can change this.</h3>
	
	<p>Open information is any information&#8212;journals, books, data, software&#8212;that is free to use, re-use, and share with attribution. Open information is disseminated faster and to a wider audience and is used and re-used more often. It encourages global participation in the pursuit of new knowledge.</p>
	
	<p>Here in the library we&#8217;re particularly passionate about Open Access&#8212;unrestricted online access to peer-reviewed scholarly content. But we're also really excited about the wider open movement.</p>
	
	<p><br /><span class="allcaps">Open Everything</span> encourages you to explore the power of Open Access, Open Data, Open Textbooks, and Open Software, and to contemplate the tension between information as a commodity and information as a public good.</p>

		<p>When he was just a sophomore in high school, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Andraka" title="Learn more about Jack Andraka at Wikipedia">Jack Andraka</a> used his science fair project as an opportunity to investigate a new diagnostic tool for pancreatic cancer, a hard-to-detect cancer that recently claimed the life of a close family friend. Andraka relied heavily on freely available, open access medical research. But he also found that many other important research articles cost upwards of $40 to access. After many hours in the lab, his research paid off. Andraka developed an innovative and affordable method for detecting pancreatic cancer. The same method is now being used to develop diagnostic tools for ovarian and lung cancer.</p>

	<p>The Open Everything exhibit was created to introduce the concept of information as a commodity and to begin a conversation about access to information. The exhibit encourages students to explore Open Access, Open Data, Open Education Resources, and Open Source Software. It is an interactive exhibit developed with the intent of making you want to learn more about the ways information is created and distributed.</p>
	<p>The physical exhibit opened at the Mary Idema Pew Library Learning and Information Commons on August 8 and ran until September 18, 2014.</p>
